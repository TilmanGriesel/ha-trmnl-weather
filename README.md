# TRMNL HomeAssistant Weather

Home Assistant weather integration for TRMNL, available via a HACS plugin alongside the TRMNL E-Ink display plugin.  
The primary goal is to visualize data from my Netatmo weather station. The integration supports device selection and automatic discovery of the weather station.  
Currently untested with other brands, but it could be extended to support additional stations with minimal effort.  
**Note:** This project is still a work in progress.
